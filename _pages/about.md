# Scientific Strategy & Publications Leader  
Translational Genomics | Infectious Disease | Immunology | Cross-Functional R&D Leadership  

I am a scientific strategy leader with 18+ years of experience driving translational biomedical research from discovery through high-impact publication, funding acquisition, and cross-functional alignment. My work bridges computational biology, infectious disease, immunology, and clinical research to shape scientific narratives that support portfolio advancement and organizational objectives.

I have led end-to-end publication strategy across multi-omics programs, secured $7M+ in competitive NIH funding, and authored 20+ peer-reviewed manuscripts including publications in *Science*, *Lancet Infectious Diseases*, *Nature Microbiology*, and *Clinical Infectious Diseases*. I specialize in translating complex biological datasets into clear, decision-enabling narratives for scientific, clinical, and executive stakeholders.
