# Welcome!

I am a computational biologist working in [Dr. Samuel Yang's](https://profiles.stanford.edu/60982) lab in the Emergency Medicine Department at Stanford University. We work on developing technologies for rapid identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of bacteria. My research focuses on developing predictive models for susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration to antibiotics based on morphological changes in imaging data. In parallel, I am also developing classification models to detect susceptibility based on nucleic acid levels in populations using cycle threshold levels from qPCR.

I received my PhD from the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. R Thane Papke](https://papke.lab.uconn.edu/) working on the mechanisms driving speciation in halophilic archaea. I surveyed the role of biogeographic distribution, temporal stability, and extensive homologous recombination in populations of halophilic archaea that drive the genesis of new species within the archael domain. My first postdoctoral training was with [Dr. Michelle Meyer](https://meyerlabrna.org/) in [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/biology.html) studying non-coding RNAs in bacteria including discovery or novel ones, definition of transcriptional boundaries, and their roles in periodontitis in the oral microbiome and the pathogenecity of * *Streptococcus pneumoniae* *.
