## Publication Governance & Scientific Narrative Strategy

I have led end-to-end publication development across interdisciplinary programs spanning computational biology, microbiology, immunology, and infectious disease. My role has included data interpretation, figure strategy, manuscript drafting, author coordination, and journal submission management.

I focus on aligning scientific outputs with broader strategic objectives — ensuring clarity of translational impact, narrative coherence, and compliance with publication standards.

## Translational & Biomarker Positioning

My work integrates multi-omics datasets to define biologically and clinically relevant insights. I specialize in translating complex molecular findings into frameworks that support funding strategy, portfolio positioning, and downstream clinical relevance.

This includes:

- Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analysis  
- Cross-dataset biological synthesis  
- Translational interpretation of infectious disease biomarkers  
- Alignment of mechanistic findings with clinical trajectories

## Cross-Functional Scientific Leadership

Across my career, I have partnered with:

- Computational biologists  
- Wet-lab experimental scientists  
- Clinical and industrial partners  
- Institutional and regulatory stakeholders  

I have coordinated interdisciplinary timelines, managed deliverables across teams, and supported strategic scientific communication at institutional and national levels.
